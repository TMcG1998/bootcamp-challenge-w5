# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
This website was created to help the user manage their daily tasks on any given day. At the top of the page you'll see the day and date. Below will have an hour block given for every hour within a standard business day (9AM to 5PM). After editing a given timeblock, the user can then choose to save that data to have it persist. If the save button is not clicked and the page is refreshed, the data will not be saved.

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JSS
* Bootstrap
* JQuery
